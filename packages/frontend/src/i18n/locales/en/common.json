  "story_guide": "In the distant west lay Trekia, an undiscovered realm home to the Trekki. The Trekki lived to wander and explore, fueled by discovering lands unknown.For eons they roamed Trekia, uncovering each secret until their world was depleted of wonders. As the Trekki were creatures nourished by wonder - they fed on discovery as others feed on food and drink, without new frontiers to uncover, their life force have faded into entropy.As hope dwindled, salvation found them in Tripo. Tripo was a rover at heart, haunted by wanderlust even trekking his world's end could not defeat. One day, Tripo stumbled upon an unseen portal and glimpsed a surreal world behind its veil. Here lay salvation for his fading race: a land bursting with mysteries to rouse their dulled souls."
